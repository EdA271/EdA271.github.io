<p><strong>TrashGPT:</strong> <br>
<sup> In a semester-long project with three fellow peers, we embarked on an exciting venture involving the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TrashTaste">Trash Taste</a> podcast. Our goal was to create a pipeline that could generate podcast transcripts mimicking the hosts&rsquo; style and personality. Through fine-tuning language models, we achieved this feat and even trained a vocoder to replicate the hosts&rsquo; voices. With this pipeline in place, we could generate new podcast episodes without the need for laborious data labeling, thanks to clustering techniques. Our project not only demonstrated the power of advanced language models but also showcased the potential to revolutionize podcast production. By integrating cutting-edge technology, we streamlined the creation process and opened up new possibilities in the realm of AI-generated audio content. Moving forward, we aim to refine our pipeline and explore further advancements, pushing the boundaries of artificial intelligence in podcast generation. <sup></p>
<p><sup>Skills: Python, Bash, NLP, Pytorch, Data Preprocessing, Model Fine-tuning, Hyperparameter tuning, Audio Synthesis<sup></p>

<p><strong>DLSS For All:</strong> <br>
<sup> As someone who spends a lot of his time gaming, and having recently gotten an RTX GPU, I was very impressed by Nvidia&rsquo;s DLSS and wanted to implement something similar. This project is exactly that, after having gained some knowledge from a few graduate Machine Learning courses, I wanted to train and implement an upscaling algorithm from scratch. I was very much satisfied with the results, however when I tried to use this model to upscale videos, it was too slow. Some future work with this project can involve making a more efficent model that is able to upscale videos in a more reasonable amount of time.<sup></p>
<p><sup>Skills: Python, Tensorflow, Image Upscaling, Data Preprocessing, Model Optimization, Hyperparameter tuning<sup></p>

<p><strong>Worth It or Not:</strong> <br>
<sup> This project was a way for me to try and estimate my enjoyment of a game that I&rsquo;m considering to potentially buy. By scraping data about the game&rsquo;s genre and estimated playtime, I developed an automated ensemble machine learning model that can predict user&rsquo;s satisfaction in a game they may be intersted in. From there I let a few of my friends (and myself) test the software and worked on making improvements such as remembering user queries, improving the search feature to be an actual search engine, UI, etc. <sup></p>
<p><sup>Skills: Python, Tensorflow, SkLearn, Automated Machine Learning, Web Scraping, CICD, Search Engine<sup></p>

<p><strong>Mastermind AI:</strong> <br>
<sup> As a kid, one of my favorite board games to play was Mastermind. If you&rsquo;re not familiar with it, it&rsquo;s a 2+ player game where one player puts together a code (4 different colors from a pool of 8) and the other player(s) has to guess the code within a certain number of steps. With each guess, the person who put together the code tells the code breaker how many colors are in the right place, and how many colors are correct but in the correct slot. This project was inspired by a sudden spark into the game of mastermind after having found the game in my basement after moving, which inspired me to make an AI for the game. <sup></p>
<p><sup>Skills: Python, AI, Command Line Interface, Algorithm Design, Game Theory<sup></p>

<p><strong>Cifar 10 CNN:</strong> <br>
<sup> As an avid enthusiast of machine learning, I embarked on an exploration of this fascinating field even before enrolling in any formal courses. Prior to delving into my studies, I chose to challenge myself by venturing beyond my initial experience with the MNIST dataset. Instead, I set my sights on the more complex Cifar 10 dataset, which comprises 60,000 32x32 color images spanning 10 distinct classes, with 6,000 images per class. To tackle the classification task, I employed a convolutional neural network. Through my efforts, I managed to achieve a commendable accuracy of 75% on the test set. This endeavor provided me with invaluable insights into the intricacies of machine learning and the inherent challenges it presents. I discovered firsthand the significance of data preprocessing and its profound impact on model performance. It became apparent that meticulous preparation of the data is vital for attaining optimal results. Looking ahead, I am eager to revisit this project in the future and venture into even more demanding datasets, such as Cifar 100 and potentially even ImageNet. By doing so, I aim to further enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of machine learning in the pursuit of tackling increasingly complex tasks.<sup></p>

<p><strong>Color Identifier:</strong> <br>
<sup> I honestly can not remember why I made this project. I think it was to settle an argument between me and one of my friends about whether the color of something was purple or burgundy, or if it was because I thought it was a cool and doable project for someone who had a strong math background but barely completed a year of their CS degree.<sup></p>
<p><sup>Skills: Python, Machine Learning, K-NN, <sup></p>
